HOSTING:

move from our server to web server (anyone can access), as individual or small to medium size business, buy from hosting company, usually a monthly fee, they will host or provide you a server you can put your files on 
mediatemple.net
bluehost.com
dreamhost.com
3 types of hosting:
Shared: share with other websites on same server, company gives you a place to put files, they give you domain
(Next 2 are to scale up(lots of monthly traffic) additional customization on server))
VPS: virtual private server: own server (linux, etc...) you can modify, allows some customization on server side
Dedicated: $$$ own piece of hardware, specific computer, exclusively hosting your website, and any other sites you want to that are yours (only one not sharing with other websites) running virtual machine on same piece of hardware 

Many hosting sites will ask if you want to purchase a domain name or ask for the domain name you already purchased
don't want to transfer registration of domain
do want to pay for a year+ of hosting, prices may be misleading- pay 10@/month


DOMAIN  /Registrar:
pay for domain with annual fee 10$
TLD: top level domain -.com .net .org - .com for commercial uses like this baking company
(premium domains are up for sale you can purchase from whoever owns it at their price)
go to domain registrar
godaddy.com
name.com
namecheap.com

pointing your domain: registrar and hosting company need to be linked up
DNS: domain name server -setup - need to copy paste stuff into your registrar
ns - 97 awsdns-01.com copy paste into domain name registrar, confirm changes

hosting using amazon web services - beyond current scope, advanced hosting option
up to 24 hours to repoint a domain
SNAG awesome domain names right away!


FTP: file transfer protocol
I'm gonna ftp that up to the server, i'm ftping it right now...hahaha

download ftp client - program to download and install onto computer we will use to connect to web host and upload our files
cyberduck (ftp client) - cyberduck.ch, downloadable through mac app store
SFTP (SSH file transfer protocol) use this! secure file transfer protocol
server, port, url, username, pass, connect
drag drop files to cyberduck
